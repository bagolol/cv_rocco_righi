**Programming bootcamp graduate currently looking for a junior developer job.**

I'm an experienced online marketer, who recently turned to coding. I enjoy developing efficient solutions to problems and learning about new technologies.
Beside Javascript, Ruby and my mother tongue Italian, I understand (and speak) German and French. I enjoy working in teams and international environments.


Skills
----------

During my time at Makers Academy I have:
- learnt how to build full stack web applications written in ruby and javascript
*Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and JavaScript (MEAN JS)*,

- acquired a solid understanding of *TDD* (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Protractor) and Agile practices. I'm at ease with version control (Git) and with project management tools (Trello and Waffle),

- practiced Pair Programming (throughout) and worked in teams of 4 to 10 people with different skills and approaches.

Languages

I learnt and keep learning many different languages:

- German, because they have a verb for feeling ashamed for someone else: **sich fremdschämen**
- French, because you want to understand [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lA7T2xc2xc)
- Hungarian, because you only need a word to say *I hate you*: **utállak**
