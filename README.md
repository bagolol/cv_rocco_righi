=========

**Programming bootcamp graduate currently looking for a junior developer job.**

I'm an experienced online marketer, who recently turned to coding. I enjoy developing efficient solutions to problems and learning about new technologies.
Beside Javascript, Ruby and my mother tongue Italian, I understand (and speak) German and French. I enjoy working in teams and international environments.


Skills
----------

During my time at Makers Academy I have:

- learnt how to build full stack web applications written in ruby and javascript
*Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and JavaScript (MEAN JS)*,

- acquired a solid understanding of *TDD* (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Protractor) and Agile practices. I'm at ease with version control (Git) and with project management tools (Trello and Waffle),

- practiced Pair Programming (throughout) and worked in teams of 4 to 10 people with different skills and approaches.


Languages
----------

I'm passionate about languages, both programming and natural:

- *JavaScript*, because it's asychronous, thus better at shaping reality
- *Ruby*, because it's elegant, concise and has the best documentation I've come across so far

- *German*, because it has a word to express pretty much every feeling and situation
- *Hungarian*, because its logic is twisted and fascinating and the vocal harmony makes it sound nice
- *French*, because old songs just sound better in French
